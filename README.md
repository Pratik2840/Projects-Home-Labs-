**Project Title: Vulnerability Assessment and Management with Nessus**

**Project Description:**

The goal of this project is to demonstrate vulnerability assessment and management using Nessus. The project involved setting up a Windows 10 machine, intentionally introducing vulnerabilities, and then performing a comprehensive vulnerability scan using Nessus.

1. **Initial Setup**: A Windows 10 machine was set up as the target for this assessment. A basic vulnerability scan was first performed on the machine to establish a baseline of vulnerabilities before intentionally introducing weaknesses.

2. **Creating Vulnerabilities**: The Windows 10 machine was configured to be vulnerable by enabling certain settings and installing outdated or insecure software, which simulates real-world scenarios of security flaws in systems.

3. **Credentialed Scan**: After making the machine vulnerable, a second scan was conducted by providing Nessus with logging credentials for the Windows 10 machine. This allowed Nessus to perform a deeper, more thorough assessment of vulnerabilities that may not be detectable with non-credentialed scans.

4. **Remediation**: The high critical vulnerabilities identified by Nessus were remediated. Patches were applied, configurations were adjusted, and insecure software was either updated or removed.

5. **Final Verification**: After remediation, a final scan was performed to verify that the vulnerabilities were successfully mitigated. The verification process ensured that no critical vulnerabilities remained.

**What I Learned:**

- **Understanding Vulnerability Scanning**: I gained a deep understanding of vulnerability scanning using Nessus, including the importance of using both non-credentialed and credentialed scans for a thorough assessment of system security.
  
- **Impact of Credentialed Scans**: The project emphasized the significant difference credentialed scans make in uncovering hidden vulnerabilities that may not be visible during a non-credentialed scan. This gave me insight into how attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if left unchecked.

- **Hands-on Experience with Remediation**: I learned how to properly address and remediate critical vulnerabilities by applying patches, adjusting configurations, and removing insecure software. This step-by-step process reinforced the importance of timely updates and secure system configurations in maintaining overall security.

- **Verification of Mitigated Vulnerabilities**: The final verification step taught me the importance of confirming the successful remediation of vulnerabilities, ensuring the security posture of the system is fully restored and that no residual risks remain.

Overall, this project enhanced my skills in vulnerability management, strengthened my understanding of the tools used in cybersecurity, and provided practical experience in securing systems against common vulnerabilities.
